### Introduction
📁 `\intro`

A few exercises and useful snippets from the introduction material.

### Thesaurus
📁 `\thesaurus`

The first application in the course:
- imports a `json` file with definitions
  - [ ] replace this with larger online resource?
- word requests inputted through the command line
- if the word is not recognised the programme uses the `difflib` library to find a close match

### Thesaurus with MySQL
📁 `\thesaurus-mysql`
- this version of the thesaurus executes an SQL query on a remote database to return the definition of a word
- the structure of the programme is similar to the first one
